 <h2>The dark side of sheep <h2>
<h3>Flysstrike and Muleing Flystrike is a horrible desiese that affects livestock like sheep and cattle-it is when fly larvae put themselves in the livestock's fleece and slowly eat away the skin and flesh of the animal. but the prevention stragety in sheep is possibly worse, in most farms they simply cut of the sheep's anus because bits of feces get caught in the wool around the anus and it attracts fly larva. This is barbaric and an outdated process (known as muleing)and causes unprecedented amounts of stress and pain to the sheep.It also doesn't allways work,pectisides and other non harmful forms of maintenence. Support the protection of sheep from barbaric muleing with #sheep with butts<h3>
